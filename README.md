# My Practice Codes in C
I am practicing the C language with a university teacher. I wanted to showcase some of my work in this repository. 
## Code 1
> Calculates the lowest common factor of two given numbers.

Compares the two numbers to learn which one is bigger also multiplies both  in order to set the boundaries. The counter is moduled with the given numbers for finding the common factor. For loop is choosen because it simplifies to find the lowest common factor, because boundaries are set and by using the “break;” comment it is possible to stop the loop when we need.
## Code 2
> Calculates how many times can the given number be divided by 2.

While loop was used to determine the lowest and highest number which the code would resume to work. The modelus operator was used in an if loop to check if the given number is eligible for being divided by 2. “/=” was choosen, so that the number could be divided by two and the variable would change depending to its eligibilty. Using  “/=” caused to use less variables, therefore it simplified the code.
## Code 3
> Calculates the digits of a given number.

While loop was used to set a minimum fort he code to stop. I chose to divide the number by 10 to find its digits. Because  dividing a number by 10 till it is equal or bigger than zero gives its digits. Additionally, I prefered to use “/=” for making the code easier to write.
